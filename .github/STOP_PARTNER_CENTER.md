# ⚠️ STOP! You're Still in Partner Center

## You Found a Payee/Payment Profile Page

If you're seeing:
- `partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payee/profiles`
- Payment information
- Tax forms
- Payout profiles
- Bank account setup

**YOU ARE STILL IN THE WRONG PLACE!**

---

## Why You Don't Need This

### Partner Center Payee Profiles are for:
- ✅ Selling paid apps in Microsoft Store
- ✅ Selling SaaS subscriptions
- ✅ Azure Marketplace paid offers
- ✅ Commercial transactions with revenue sharing

### Visual Studio Extensions (VSIX) are:
- ❌ **FREE** - No payments involved
- ❌ **Open source** - No revenue
- ❌ **No transactions** - Just downloads

**YOU DON'T NEED PAYMENT/PAYEE SETUP FOR FREE EXTENSIONS!**

## Direct Links - Use These!

### ✅ RIGHT - Visual Studio Marketplace
**Publisher Management:** https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage  
**Create Publisher:** https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/createpublisher  
**Get PAT:** https://dev.azure.com (Settings → Personal Access Tokens)

### ❌ WRONG - Partner Center (Don't Use!)
~~partner.microsoft.com/dashboard~~ ← Close this!  
~~partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payee~~ ← Don't need this!  
~~partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account~~ ← Ignore this!

## Why Is This So Confusing?

Microsoft has multiple marketplace systems:

| Portal | For | Example Products |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| **Partner Center** | Paid/Commercial | Office 365 apps, Azure paid services, Windows Store paid apps |
| **VS Marketplace** | Free Developer Tools | Visual Studio extensions, VSCode extensions, Azure DevOps extensions |

**You're building a Visual Studio extension → Use VS Marketplace (the simple one!)**

## The Only 3 Things You Need

1. **Microsoft Account** ← You have: david@planworkdone.com ✅
2. **VS Marketplace Publisher** ← Create at: marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage (2 min) ⏳
3. **Personal Access Token** ← Create at: dev.azure.com (2 min) ⏳

**That's it! No payments, no taxes, no forms!**

## If You're Still Confused

**Ask yourself:** "Does my extension cost money?"
- **NO** → Use marketplace.visualstudio.com (simple!)

**The EF Designer extension is FREE → You only need marketplace.visualstudio.com!**

## Summary in 3 Sentences

1. **Partner Center** is for selling commercial software (you don't need it)
2. **VS Marketplace** is for publishing free extensions (you DO need this)
3. **Go to:** marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage and forget about Partner Center!
